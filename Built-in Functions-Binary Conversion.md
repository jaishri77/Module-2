# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
a = 16
print(bin(a))
```

## Output
```
0b10000
```

## Result

The program converts the number 16 to its binary representation, which is 10000, prefixed with 0b to indicate it's a binary number.
